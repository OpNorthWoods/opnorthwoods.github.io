### Privacy, anti-government, human-first-security.

## Surika
> This is a personal code shaped by the world we live in, where data is traded like currency, obedience is expected, and surveillance never blinks. It wasn't made for comfort. It was made for survival, in the mind, and, if it comes to it, in the real world. I assume systems are already compromised. I donâ€™t trust software by default. I prepare for worst case scenarios: a knock at the door, a breach of air gapped machines, manipulated firmware, and state backed lies meant to confuse and divide.
