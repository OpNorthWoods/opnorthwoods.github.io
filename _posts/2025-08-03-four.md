title: "Mobile Security & Custom ROMs"
date: 2025-08-03

Hell yeah, lets dive into fortifying your mobile devices with custom ROMs, hardened configurations, and strict OPSEC protocols. 
Mobile endpoints are often the weakest link risky by design, FULL of sensors, radios, and always on connectivity. 

Our goal is to reshape a standard smartphone into a purpose built security appliance resilient against network attacks, data exfiltration, physical compromise, and even state level interception.

### Custom ROM Implementation

Selecting a custom ROM is the first step to wrest control away from traditional OEM firmware. 
By replacing stock Android builds with community driven alternatives, you gain transparency, faster security patches, and the ability to disable unwanted services. 

Below is a quick comparison of top choices each tuned for different threat levels and hardware.

| ROM          | Security Level | Device Support | Update Frequency | Privacy Features                     |
|--------------|---------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|--------------------------------------|
| **GrapheneOS** | Maximum        | Pixel 4+       | Monthly          | Hardened kernel, verified boot, strict sandboxing |
| **CalyxOS**    | Very High      | Pixel 3+       | Monthly          | MicroG compatibility, granular firewall    |
| **LineageOS**  | High           | Wide range     | Weekly           | Privacy Guard, rootless safety wrappers   |
| **DivestOS**   | High           | Multi-device   | Weekly           | Bromite browser, enhanced SELinux policies |

GrapheneOS offers the strongest isolation of apps and hardware features, making it ideal for high value targets or journalists in hostile environments. 

CalyxOS strikes a balance: built-in MicroG restores essential Google APIs without compromising privacy. 

LineageOS and DivestOS cater to a broader device lineup but require more manual vetting of community builds.

> Choose a ROM with an active maintainer community. Security updates more than often lag on abandoned ports.

### Device Hardening Procedures

After flashing your ROM, further harden the device configuration. 
This section walks through each phase from backing up existing data to disabling unused hardware sensors and tightening network settings.

#### Pre-Installation Preparation

Before tampering with your device:

1. **Encrypted Backup**  
   Use `adb` or your chosen backup tool to export user data. Always protect the backup file with a strong passphrase or on a encrypted disk.
2. **Download & Verify**  
   - Grab the ROM, recovery image, and any add-ons (Magisk, GApps) only from official channels.  
   - Verify SHA256 checksums and PGP signatures against developer keys.  
3. **Install Custom Recovery**  
   Flash TWRP or OrangeFox in bootloader mode. Confirm you can boot into recovery before proceeding.

#### Flash & Configure

```bash
fastboot flashing unlock
fastboot flash recovery twrp.img
adb reboot recovery

# In TWRP:
# Wipe > Advanced Wipe > select dalvik, cache, system, data
# Install > ROM zip > GApps zip > Magisk zip
```

- **Unlock Bootloader:** Voids warranty, but of course is necessary.
- **Wipe Partitions:** Ensures no residual OEM code.  
- **Flash ROM & Add-Ons:** Flash in order: ROM > optional GApps > Magisk (systemless root).  

#### Post-Installation Hardening

Once booted:

- **Enable Full Disk Encryption** via Settings > Security > Encryption.  
- **Set Strong Lock Screen**: Use a long alphanumeric passphrase over PIN or pattern.  
- **Disable Unused Radios**: Turn off NFC, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi when idle or better yet remove them completely.  
- **Harden SELinux**: Enforce mode only (no permissive) 
- **Install LSPosed Modules**: Use Riru + LSPosed for fine grained app controls

> Keep a tested recovery image and backups on a separate, encrypted storage device.

**Installation Time & Risk**  
- **Time:** 2–4 hours per device  
- **Risk:** Medium (brick potential if done retard-ly)
- **Recovery:** TWRP allows restoring backups  
- **Warranty:** Voided by bootloader unlock

### The FOSS App Ecosystem

Custom ROMs are just the foundation.
A truly hardened device runs only Free/Open Source apps transparent code, no hidden trackers or spyware.

### Mobile OPSEC

Yeah.. Here we go again with OPSEC.

A hardened device can still leak metadata or be physically compromised.

> **Reference: EFF Mobile Guide**  
> Source: [eff.org/mobile](https://www.eff.org/mobile)

#### Physical Security
- **Faraday Pouches:** Keep devices in signal-blocking bags when not used.  
- **Screen Filters:** Prevent shoulder surfing in public spaces.  
- **Routine Sweeps:** Inspect for hidden GPS trackers or microphones.  
- **Secure Disposal:** Decommission old devices by physical destruction or degaussing.

#### Digital Security
- **Regular Updates:** Schedule monthly flash cycles to apply patches.  
- **Permission Audits:** Weekly reviews of app permissions; remove unused apps.  
- **Network Monitoring:** Deploy `tshark` or `tcpdump` on device or via tethered laptop.  
- **Encrypted Backups:** Store backups on air gapped drives with key encryption.

#### Network & Profile Isolation
- **Work Profile via Shelter:** Segregate "mission critical" apps from personal data.  
- **Always-On VPN:** WireGuard tunnel that launches at boot, routing all traffic.  
- **DNS over HTTPS/TLS:** Prevent DNS leaks by specifying trusted resolvers.  
- **Traffic Obfuscation:** Use Snowflake or meek on Tor for evading DPI.

> **Host comment:** Discipline is as important as technology, don't get hooked staright on social media after install. Practice safe, like your mom should've.

#### Essential Magisk Modules
- **Riru + LSPosed:** Hook framework for runtime permission and behavior control
- **Universal SafetyNet Fix:** Restore SafetyNet compatibility for banking apps
- **Systemless Hosts:** Block ads and malicious domains without modifying `/etc/hosts` 
- **BusyBox for Android:** Provides advanced command line tools

#### Privacy Enhancements
- **App Ops:** Fine-tune permission prompts per session or per network
- **Disable Sensors:** Turn off gyroscope, barometer, or microphone when unused
- **Network Monitor:** Real time logs of outbound connections to catch anomalies
- **Sensor Spoofing:** Provide fake location or movement data to confuse trackers

> **Host comment:** Test each module in isolation before combining to avoid the dreaded boot loops

| SS7 Attack       | Passive network monitoring| Burner rotation, VPN          | \$100–300   |
| Spoofed Tower    | Signal strength anomalies | Manual network selection      | \$0         |
| SIM Swap         | Account alert services    | Multi-SIM redundancy, VPN     | \$20–100    |

> **Host comment:** Regularly check for unexpected roaming events or GSM registration logs

### The Burner Phone Lifecycle

Burner phones are disposable but require strict handling to maintain anonymity.

#### Acquisition & Activation
1. **Cash Purchase** at varied retailers under alias
2. **Unbox & Strip**: Remove serial sticker, repackage in generic pouch
3. **SIM Prep**: Use prepaid SIMs without registration or even better [Crypto-Paid ESIMs](https://simsup.net/shop/digital-esim/)
4. **Initial Setup** on public WiFi no personal accounts

| **H2O Wireless**| Pay-as-you-go calls  | \$0.05/min   | None           | Maximum         |

> Even though you may want a phisical sim I always recommend an anonymous crypto-paid eSIM my personal recommendation is [SimUP](https://simsup.net/shop/digital-esim/). It's about 27.95€ to make calls, send texts, and use data.
> You can even recharge it regularly with the amount you want. I recommend topup and paying in XMR.
> You can click [Here](https://simsup.net/shop/digital-esim/?aff=10) to use my link on SimUp to get me some yummy XMR when you purchase.

### Mobile Security Checklist

> **Reference: NIST Cybersecurity Framework**  
> Source: [nist.gov/cyberframework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

**Daily:**  
- Verify ROM and app update status  
- Audit new permissions granted  
- Monitor real time network logs  
- Ensure full disk encryption remains active  

**Weekly:**  
- Perform full backup and test restore  
- Review device inventory and usage logs  
- Simulate device compromise and recovery  

**Monthly:**  
- Reflash ROM from clean build  
- Rotate all burner devices and SIMs  
- Conduct refresher training drills  

Treat each device as a high-risk asset. Assume compromise at all times. 
Assume the worst, prepare for everything, and never let convenience compromise your safety.
