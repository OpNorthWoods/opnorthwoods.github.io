## Why 'Secure' Isn't Actually What You Think.
When I say something is *"secure,"* I don't mean it's bulletproof. I just mean it's usually a safer choice than mainstream services like Google Drive or Dropbox.

But here's the catch: a lot of these so called "secure file hosts" make big promises they don't always live up to. Privacy policies go out of date, terms of service change quietly, and sometimes the security features are more marketing than reality. So you should always be careful about what you trust with your data.

The truth is, the only truly secure setup is hosting your own service. That way, you know exactly where your files are and who has access. Even then, it's not a free pass running your own system means dealing with software bugs, vulnerabilities, and the responsibility of keeping everything patched and locked down.

## Why Not Mainstream Cloud Services 
Let's get honest: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, whatever you use they're not built for real privacy or security. They are for convenience, wrapped in marketing that tells you everything is "secure".  

### Here's why you should be cautious:
- **Tracking & Profiling:** Every file, document, and image you upload can be scanned. Google indexes content for search, ads, and "security features” Dropbox and others do similar scans. 

- **Emergency Data Requests (EDRs):** Even if the service seems private, comprimised governments or law enforcement emails can force providers to hand over your data, sometimes **instantly** via subpoenas, National Security Letters, or EDRs. Some of these requests come with gag orders, so the provider can't tell you. You could be fully compliant with the law and still have your sensitive files accessed without your knowledge. EDRs have been so common as of recent due to the addition of Kodex via stealer logs and malware attacks against governments.  
> The use of EDRs has become increasingly common recently, fueled by the integration of tools like Kodex-Global for LE, threat actors will search into stealer logs targeting these logins and start malware campaigns targeting government systems.

- **Centralized Storage == Single Point of Failure:** All your files live on servers controlled by a single company. A breach, insider threat, misconfiguration, or even a rogue employee (more common than you would think, see verizon, microsoft and other examples.) can expose massive amounts of data in one swoop.

- **Limited Encryption:** Most mainstream cloud services encrypt your files in transit and at rest but **they hold the keys**. They can decrypt your files anytime for legal or operational reasons.

If you store sensitive files on Google Drive or Dropbox, you are **trusting the company, your endpoints, and the legal system simultaneously**. Any of these can fail, and your data can be exposed in ways you cannot control. 

### Convenience is the enemy of security.
**What to do instead:**  
1. Use **Tor-based file sharing** (OnionShare, Privfiles) for sensitive transfers.  
2. Consider **self-hosted encrypted services** to control your own keys.  
3. Operate under the assumption that any endpoint or provider could be compromised and plan accordingly.  

There is no magic solution. Convenience always comes at the cost of privacy. Anyone telling you otherwise is selling something.

## The Services
No service is perfect. "Secure” is always relative, and it really comes down to how much risk you're willing to manage.
Below is a researched comparison of clearnet, Tor, and self-hostable file services.  
They are sorted by **maximum file size** for easy reference for you.

### Takeaways
1. Clearnet services like SwissTransfer or Wormhole are easy to use but depend on your trust in the provider. Logs and legal compliance vary by jurisdiction.  
2. Tor-based hosts (OnionShare, Eternal Hosting, Onion Cloud, Privfiles) offer the best anonymity, availability is less reliable.  
3. Self hosted options (YeetFile, RetroShare, EOTK) are the most secure if you can maintain your own server or node.  
4. Whistleblower platforms (SecureDrop, StrongBox, GlobaLeaks) are battle tested, but designed for journalists, not general file sharing.  
5. Size vs. Security tradeoffs, bigger the host, the more likely it's centralized and monitored. OnionShare, despite being "dynamic" in size, is still the most privacy respecting choice.

If you're serious about privacy, the **best practice** is:
- Use **OnionShare** for one off, sensitive transfers.  
- Use **self hosted encrypted vaults** (YeetFile, RetroShare) for long term files or projects.  
- Avoid clearnet hosts for anything critical they are built for convenience, not security.
