> **Host comment:** Sup fuckers, this guide applies only to U.S. federal and state tax systems every elite you know uses these and don't make them public so you suffer.

Every security strategy starts with a solid legal foundation. 
When you’re preparing for high stakes scenarios whether you face corporate subpoenas or raids your choice of entity matters almost as much as your firewalls and air-gaps.

## 1.1 Legal & Ownership

In this section, we outline three popular LLC structures, their advantages, and why you might pick one over the other.

| Structure       | Difficulty | Security Risk (Identity) | Benefits                                  |
|-----------------|-----------:|-------------------------:|-------------------------------------------|
| Wyoming LLC     |      Easy  | Low (anonymous)          | No state tax, *anonymous ownership!*      |
| Nevada LLC      |      Easy  | Low (anonymous)          | No state tax, no member disclosure        |
| Delaware LLC    |   Medium   | Medium                   | Asset protection case law, VC-friendly    |

> **Host comment:** Wyoming and Nevada allow nominee manager services to further obscure ownership.
